### Features

 - It's fairly light on resources
 - Optional line numbers
 - Optional auto-indent
 - Multiple buffer support
 - vi-like keybinds
 - Modal (similar to vi)
 
### Tabs
 
In insert mode, pressing the tab key will insert spaces (4 by default).
There is no way to indent with tab characters instead.
If you open a file which contains tab characters, you will undoubtedly face problems.
